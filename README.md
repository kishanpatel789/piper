# Piper Gradient - Challenge 1

## Description
This is a final deliverable of a practicum while enrolled in the Master of Science in Analytics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The project is a small component of the Piper Team's larger endeavor to provide a more comprehensive sample of social media posts. The project addresses Challenge 1 by creating models that cluster social media posts into semantic categories. The datasets of interest are a collection of Tweets associated with the American Jobs Plan promoted by the President Biden Administration. This project utilizes two methods to first create clusters of Tweets sharing similar opinions. Then the Tweets within the clusters are analyzed to determine which traits affect cluster assignments.
